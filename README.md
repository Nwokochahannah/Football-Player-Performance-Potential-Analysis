# Football-Player-Performance-Potential-Analysis
#### Project Goals and Objectives

Football Player Performance & Potential Analysis is a project to analyse the performance of football players from the top 5 leagues in Europe in the 2023/2024 season. The goal of the project is to evaluate how football players in the these leagues performed in the 2023/2024 season, focusing on key metrics such as goals, assists, defensive actions, and other relevant performance indicators and to compare real-life player statistics with their potential ratings provided by EA Sports to identify:
- **Overperformers**: Players whose real-life stats exceed their EA ratings.
- **Underperformers**: Players with high EA potential but lower-than-expected real-life performance.

#### Dataset Descriptions

##### 1. Top 5 Leagues Dataset
This dataset contains performance statistics for players in the top 5 European football leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1) during the 2023/2024 season. It includes detailed player statistics such as goals, assists, defensive actions, and passing accuracy. Key features in the dataset include:
- **Player Name**: The full name of the player.
- **Position**: The player’s field position (e.g., midfielder, striker).
- **Goals**: Total goals scored during the season.
- **Assists**: Number of assists provided.
- **Minutes Played**: Total minutes the player has been on the fiel#d.

#### 2. EA Sports Dataset
This dataset contains the FIFA 2024 ratings and potential scores for football players globally. It includes attributes like pace, dribbling, shooting, and physicality, as well as an overall potential rating that predicts a player’s growth over time. Key features include:
- **Overall Rating**: A score representing the player's overall skill level.
- **Potential Rating**: A projection of the player’s future potential.
- **Physical Attributes**: Metrics such as height, strength, and stamina.
- **Technical Skills**: Ratings for skills like passing, shooting, and dribbling.

#### Key Questions & Hypotheses

As we delve into the comparison between real-life player performance and their potential as rated by EA Sports, the following key questions and hypotheses will guide our analysis:
-
1. **Are high-potential players performing better in real life?**
   - Hypothesis: Players with higher potential ratings in EA Sports are more likely to perform well in real-life matches (e.g., scoring more goals or providing more assists).
   - Investigative Question: Do players with an EA potential rating above 85 show statistically better real-life performance in terms of goals, assists, and key defensive actions?

2. **Which players are over-performing their potential?**
   - Hypothesis: Some players may outperform their EA Sports potential rating, indicating they are undervalued or underrated in the game.
   - Investigative Question: Are there players with an EA potential rating below 80 who have exceeded expectations by delivering top-tier real-life performances?

3. **Are younger players (under 23) living up to their potential?**
   - Hypothesis: Younger players with high potential ratings are expected to show significant real-life growth, especially in the top 5 leagues.
   - Investigative Question: How do real-life performances of young players under 23 years old compare to their EA potential ratings? Are they meeting or exceeding expectations?

4. **What is the relationship between a player's position and their real-life vs potential performance?**
   - Hypothesis: Certain positions (e.g., forwards or midfielders) may have a stronger correlation between EA potential ratings and real-life performance.
   - Investigative Question: Does a forward with a high potential rating (e.g., above 90) show a greater impact on goals and assists than a similarly rated defender’s impact on defensive metrics?

5. **Do players from certain leagues consistently outperform or underperform their potential?**
   - Hypothesis: Players from specific leagues (e.g., Premier League, La Liga) may perform closer to their EA potential compared to players in other leagues.
   - Investigative Question: Are players in the Premier League more likely to meet or exceed their potential ratings compared to those in Serie A or Bundesliga?
